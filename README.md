# Web push support
If your site was created using older versions of Modyo ( 10.0 or lower) you may need to update your register and service_worker files.

## How to use it:


- Go to channels > web application and locate your old site that needs update.
- Find templates > snippets and open `service_worker_js` and `register_js` and replace the code
- Verify thay your web app has PWA support enabled

## More information
See modyo documentation

- (PWA configuration)[https://docs.modyo.com/en/platform/channels/sites.html#pwa]
- (Web Push Notifications)[https://docs.modyo.com/en/platform/customers/messaging.html]

Note: Use this code only for older sites, if you create a new app web push is already supported.
